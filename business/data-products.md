**DSSC Description**

Data product development considers data product templates for the data providers, data space governance rules for the data products and network effects between data providers and users.

Data products are basic units of data space use cases. While data spaces follow the distributed design and differ in this regard from centralised platforms, many aspects of platform economics apply. An essential value driver in data spaces is establishing network effects between the ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ of data. Access to a good selection of data products will attract data users, and a large user base will attract more data providers.
