**DSSC Description**

Business model development supports a data space in developing its business model by identifying the key elements of a data space business model and identifying some considerations the governance authority should take into account while developing its business model.

The data space business model refers to the business logic of the data space governance authority responsible for sustaining and developing the operations and governance of the data space. A data space business model defines how the data space creates and delivers value for its participants and how it captures value to become sustainable over time. Unless the data space is a continuously publicly funded infrastructure, it needs to have a value capture mechanism, which could be some sort of data space usage fee for the participants. Crafting the data space business model requires understanding the other business models of the participants around use cases, data products and intermediaries. However, those business models are not in the scope of the data space business model.
