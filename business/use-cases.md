# Use cases

The iSHARE Trust Framework describes [three primary use cases](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/primary-use-cases), explaining the basic design and implementation of the Trust Framework:

1. [Machine-to-machine service provision](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/1-m2m-service-provision)
2. [Human-to-machine service provision with identity info at the Service Provider](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/2-h2m-service-provision-with-identity-info-at-the-)
3. [Human-to-machine service provision with identity info at the Identity Provider](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/3-h2m-service-provision-with-identity-info-at-the-)

The three primary use cases are supported by [seven secondary use cases](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/secondary-use-cases).

A more practical description of the frameworks functionality is provided in [these four example use cases](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/use-cases).

These use cases provide a generic overview of functionality the framework provides. In order to get a more practical view on provided functionality by this particular dataspace, it is suggested to provide real life examples under this page, that resonate with (potential) dataspace participants.

**DSSC description**

Use case development is a strategic approach to amplify the value of a data space by fostering the creation, support and scaling of use cases.

The use cases depend on the data space to solve business challenges or create value for one or more data space participants. The use cases generate demand and potential customers for the data space, and the data space facilitates the cost-efficient implementation of those use cases. For the data space to achieve financial sustainability, it needs to attract use cases that generate income through data space usage fees, and its costs for serving these use cases must be lower than the total revenue obtained from all of them. Each use case connects additional participants and data products to the data space. These participants and data products are then readily available for other use cases. A vital part of the data space business model is to boost such synergies between use cases.
