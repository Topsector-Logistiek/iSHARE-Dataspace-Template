# Organisational governance

The dataspace governing body takes part in the [governance of the iSHARE Trust Framework](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/governance-framework) in order to influence the development of the iSHARE Trust Framework, so that it's applicability to this dataspace is ensured. Representatives take part in the following governance bodies:

* Supervisory Board
* Council Of Participants
* Change Advisory Board

The iSHARE Trust Framework doesn't provide in governance agreements for dataspaces. The dataspace is free to define it's own governance.

**DSSC Description**

Organisational governance guides setting up the data space governance authority by identifying key decision points and options for establishing inclusive governance and transparent rules and roles.

Within a data space, organisational governance is needed to guide the participants to organise the data space and achieve their goals. Governance in a data space is multi-faceted and encompasses various key decisions. Examples of these key decision points include the scope of the data space, the position the data space initiative wishes to take in the ecosystem, openness concerning entering participants, the support it wishes to arrange for its participants, or the principles it wishes to implement (e.g. democratic). The specific choices made will differ between data spaces, but they should aim to promote collaborative, multi-stakeholder governance for effective data space operation.
