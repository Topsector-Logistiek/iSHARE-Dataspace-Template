**DSSC Description**

The purpose of the publication and discovery building block is to provision and discover metadata of data, services and offerings in a data space, i.e. their formal descriptions as explained in more detail in Data, Services and Offerings Descriptions. Descriptions of offerings are published by a provider and stored inside a catalogue, where the provider is responsible for managing their lifecycle, from when they are published to when they are removed. After publication, consumers can query the available offerings inside the catalogue and find (i.e. discover) best-match offerings.
