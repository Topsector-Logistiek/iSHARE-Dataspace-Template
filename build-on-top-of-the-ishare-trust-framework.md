# Build on top of the iSHARE Trust Framework

This dataspace is designed on the basis of the [iSHARE Trust Framework](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/). The complete iSHARE Trust Framework is to be considered applicable. Any deviations from the framework are explicitly highlighted in the text of these pages. These pages however contain more agreements than there are present in the iSHARE Trust Framework, since the iSHARE Trust Framework covers only some of the dataspace building blocks that are described in these pages.
