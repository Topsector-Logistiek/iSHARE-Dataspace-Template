# Service level agreements

This dataspace adheres to iSHARE agreements on service levels. These agreements are defined here:

* [Service levels](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/service-levels)
* [Service levels for Adhering Parties](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/service-levels-for-adhering-parties)
* [Service levels for Certified Parties/Satellite](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/service-levels-for-certified-parties-satellite)

The service levels for Satellites or Data space authorities are monitored by the Foundation as the Scheme Owner. For each data space, the members can define service levels more firm or specific but not conflicting with ones defined by the Framework. A service level requirement for 95% availability can be set to 99% if it is more applicable for the data space but not be reduced to 80%.
